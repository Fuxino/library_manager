library_manager
==============
Library_manager is a simple program I wrote to manage my Library database

A PKGBUILD for Arch Linux is provided.

## Usage
Library_manager works with the Library database I created to manage my books. I included the Sql file that allows to recreate the database structure.

## Dependencies
The program is written in `Python3` and uses `PyQt5` for the GUI. The database connection is made through `mysql-connector`.
